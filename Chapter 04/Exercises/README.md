#### Q4-1: We noted in ยง4.2.3/65 that it is essential that the argument types in a call to `max` match exactly. Will the following code work? If there is a problem, how would you fix it?
```c++
int maxlen;
Student_info s;
max(s.name.size(), maxlen);
```
No, because `s.name.size()` returns a value of type `size_t`. In order to make this program work, we will have to change `maxlen` type from `int` to `string::size_t`.

#### Q4-2. Write a program to calculate the squares of `int` values up to 100. The program should write two columns: The first lists the value; the second contains the square of that value. Use `setw` to manage the output so that the values line up in columns.
> `setw(n)`: Returns a value of type `streamsize` (ยง3.1/36) that, when written on an output stream `s`, has the effect of calling `s.width(n)`.

The solution can be found in [q02](Chapter04/Exercises/q02.cpp).

#### Q4-3. What happens if we rewrite the previous program to allow values up to but not including 1000 but neglect to change the arguments to `setw`? Rewrite the program to be more robust in the face of changes that allow `i` to grow without adjusting the `setw` arguments.
The left and right columns will blend as the widths of both cease to hold the numbers as they grow.

The updated program can be found in [q02](Chapter04/Exercises/q03.cpp).

#### Q4-4. Now change your squares program to use double values instead of `int`s. Use manipulators to manage the output so that the values line up in columns.

#### Q4-5. Write a function that reads words from an input stream and stores them in a vector. Use that function both to write programs that count the number of words in the input, and to count how many times each word occurred.

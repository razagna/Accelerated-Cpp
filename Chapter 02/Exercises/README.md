#### Q2-0. Compile and run the program presented in this chapter.
The framing program for this chapter can be viewed in theÂ [framing.cpp](../Examples/framing.cpp).

#### Q2-1: Change the framing program so that it writes its greeting with no separation from the frame.
This can be simply achieved by setting the `pad` variable, which represents the vertical and horizontal spacing between the greeting and frames, to zero. The solution can be found in [q01](q01.cpp).

#### Q2-2. Change the framing program so that it uses a different amount of space to separate the sides from the greeting than it uses to separate the top and bottom borders from the greeting.
This can be achieved by using two variables instead of one to hold the values of the horizontal and vertical padding. The solution can be found in [q02](q02.cpp).

#### Q2-3. Rewrite the framing program to ask the user to supply the amount of spacing to leave between the frame and the greeting.
This can be achieved by prompting the user for the value to use for padding and then storing their input in the variable that will be used for calculating the positions of the greeting and frame. The solution can be found in [q03](q03.cpp).

#### Q2-4. The framing program writes the mostly blank lines that separate the borders from the greeting one character at a time. Change the program so that it writes all the spaces needed in a single output expression.
This can be achieved by constructing two `string`s, one for the padding done to the top and bottom of the greeting, which is equal to the number of columns minus two, and one for the padding done to the sides of the greeting, which is equal to the `pad` variable. The side padding is outputted when we reach the middle column where the greeting will be printed, and the top and padding padding is outputted when we are above or below the greeting but not on the frame. And depending on which string was outputted, the `cols` variable, which designates the current column number, is incremented accordingly. The solution can be found in [q04](q04.cpp).

#### Q2-5. Write a set of "*" characters so that they form a square, a rectangle, and a triangle.
This was achieved by writing three `for` loops that go through the desired number of rows and prints stars and spaces in accordance with the shape. The solution can be found in [q05](q05.cpp).

#### Q2-6. What does the following code do?
```c++
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
	i += 1;
	std::cout << i << std::endl;
}
```
It instantiates a new integer variable called `i` with the value 0 and keeps adding one to it and then printing the value of `i` until `i` reaches the value 10, after which it stops.

#### Q2-7. Write a program to count down from 10 to -5.
The program consists of a simple `for` loop that starts with an integer with the value of 10 and decrements the integer and outputs the result while the integer's value is less than -6. The program can be viewed in [q07](q07.cpp).

#### Q2-8. Write a program to generate the product of the numbers in the range `[1, 10)`.
The program initiates with 1 an integer variable called `result` to store the multiplication result in, then enters a for loop where values from 1 until 9 are multiplied to the `result` variable and the result is store back in the variable itself. The program can be checked in [q08](q08.cpp).

#### Q2-9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers and tells the user which number is larger than the other.
The program prompts the user for the two numbers and uses `std::cin` to read the input values into two `int` variables. It then uses a conditional `if` statement to compare the two integers and depending on which is larger outputs a custom message. The program can be viewed in [q09](q09.cpp).

#### Q2-10. Explain each of the uses of std:: in the following program:
```c++
int main() {
int k = 0;
   while (k != n) { // invariant: we have written k asterisks so far
      using std::cout;
      cout << "*";
      ++k;
   }
   std::cout << std::endl; // std:: is required here
   return 0;
}
```
The `using std::cout` statement communicates that we will be using `cout` to refer to `std::cout` onward. However, this using-declaration is constrained within the `while` loop. So once we exit the loop, it goes out of scope, hence why `std::` was used to qualify `cout` and `endl` in the subsequent line.
